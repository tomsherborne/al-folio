abstract = {Image captioning as a multimodal task has drawn much interest in recent years. However, evaluation for this task remains a challenging problem. Existing evaluation metrics focus on surface similarity between a candidate caption and a set of reference captions, and do not check the actual relation between a caption and the underlying visual content. We introduce a new diagnostic evaluation framework for the task of image captioning, with the goal of directly assessing models for grammaticality, truthfulness and diversity (GTD) of generated captions. We demonstrate the potential of our evaluation framework by evaluating existing image captioning models on a wide ranging set of synthetic datasets that we construct for diagnostic evaluation. We empirically show how the GTD evaluation framework, in combination with diagnostic datasets, can provide insights into model capabilities and limitations to supplement standard evaluations.},
