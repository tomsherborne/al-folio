I’m a 1st year PhD student in the [ILCC group](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at Informatics Edinburgh working on natural language understanding. My topic is semantic parsing, supervised by [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/index.php?page=index), and I'm part of the [CDT in Data Science](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk) 

Previously, I was an intern at Siri Cambridge and I completed the MPhil in Computer Science at [The Computer Lab](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk), working with [Ann Copestake](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aac10/) on multimodal semantics. My undergrad was at [UCL EEE](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/), working with [Polina Bayvel](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/people/prof-polina-bayvel) on hardware optimisation for optical signal processing.

I’m interested in natural language understanding, machine learning, python and croissants.
